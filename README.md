# Torch-ResNet
1st practice with pytorch

## main.py
+ can evaluate model with CIFAR-10 dataset
+ modified codes from https://tutorials.pytorch.kr/beginner/blitz/cifar10_tutorial.html


## resnet.py
+ implemented residual block & bottleneck block (Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition, 2015)
+ used full pre-activation (Identity Mappings in Deep Residual Networks ,2016)
+ designed simple ResNet32, ResNet224 and ResNet448 manually (each number does not mean network depth but input image size)
